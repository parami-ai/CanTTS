## Subsets
CanTTS roughly divides the sentences into 3 subsetes according to the sentence type.

- FN contains daily used sentences and to some extent reflects the distribution of different sentence types. Most sentences in FN are statements, but there are also some questions. 

- FQ contains normal questions where the interrogative intentions are reflected by the linguistic contents.

- FU consists of declarative questions, i.e., questions with their linguistic contents being the same as statements. For those declarative questions, the speaker utters with rising intonation.

| subset | content | utterances | duration (hours) |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| FN | daily used sentences, mostly statements | 10010 | 18.37 |
| FQ | normal questions without significant rising intonation | 1000 | 0.92 |
| FU | declarative questions expressed with rising intonation | 1000 | 0.88 |
